# Summary

Implemented the ability to switch between themes (Dark & Light), theme colors configured in "theme.configs.js" file. 
Ability to search for Movies and TV Shows fetched data from the "TheMovieDB" website. 
Configured endpoints on the server side for displaying movies and shows by category (popular, top rated, favorites).
Made auth options for "SignIn" and "SignUp", the Logged-in User has the option of adding content(movies & shows) to his favorites so that he can remember and watch it maybe later.
